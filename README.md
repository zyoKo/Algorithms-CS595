# Data Structures and Algorithms
List of Algorithms implemented:
  - Convex Hull
  - Johnson-Trotter Permutations
  - Lexicographical Permutation
  - Knapsack Brute Force (min change) using Gray Codes
  - In-Place Merge Sort (Aux Array, O(n))

## Usage
1. Contains `Makefile` to test on Linux or Windows Teminal with WSL support.

2. Clone the Repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/zyoKo/Algorithms-CS595.git
```

3. Run `scripts\generate_vs_files.bat` and open `Algorithms.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.

4. Select the project you want to run and set it as StartUp Project. (`Right Click(On any projeect) -> Set As StartUp Project`)

5. Run in `Release` mode. (For better performance)
