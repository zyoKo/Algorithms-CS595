Implement Johnson-Trotter algorithm.
Make sure your output matches "out0".

Note:
I implemented directions as follows:
std::vector<int> dir; 
which had values -1 for left and 1 for right, it allowed me to
check for mobility like this
element[i] > element[i+dir[i]].

To submit:
perm-jt.cpp
perm-jt.h
