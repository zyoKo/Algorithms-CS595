This is a continuation of the electric Dijkstra assignment:


////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Previous assignment:
// You are exploring a problem whether a particular electric vehicle is acceptable
// for a given town. The main question is - given the range of the vehicle (range
// is based on a full charge) will that vehicle be able to go from any location to
// any other location with the maximum of K recharges.
// 
// Problem: given the graph and number of recharges and the maximum range of a
// vehicle, will that vehicle be able to reach any location from any other
// location? 
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////


For this lab you are given a graph and the maximum number of recharges. You
have to calculate the minimum range (on a full battery charge) that will allow
the vehicle to visit any location from any other location with the given
maximum number of recharges.

Idea: 
use your solution for the assignment to find the minimum:
range           1 2 3 4 .... M-1 M
range is enough F F F F ....  F  T  <-- stop and return M

Whether the range is enough uses previous assignment.

But this will be very slow. Use binary search instead 
R_min  range is not enough
R_max  range is enough
try
(R_max+R_min)/2
if it is enough R_max = (R_max+R_min)/2
if not          R_min = (R_max+R_min)/2

Things to think about:
1) what is the initial R_min?
2) what is the initial R_max?
