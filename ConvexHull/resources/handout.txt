Implement convex hull brute force:
1) hullBruteForce: for each pair points determine whether all other points
are one side of the line formed by the pair of points. If it does - add the
points (or rather indices to the hull). Since hull is represented by 
a std::set, you do not have to worry about duplicates.

2) hullBruteForce2: find the first point that is in the hull (smalles or 
biggest x or y coordinate), then find the next vertex of the hull in 
counter-clockwise order by considering all lines through the previous vertex 
and requiring that there are no points to the right of it.

To submit:
hull-bruteforce.cpp
